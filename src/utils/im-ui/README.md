## Im-UI

An optional directory to vendor. It contains various UI elements and UI-related utils that I use for my stuff. 
They serve as an example of how to use the framework, and one possible way to organise a UI design system.
I figure the UI framework would be more useful if it actually came with a bunch of UI component.

NOTE: they do _not_ serve as an example of how to design things that look nice, unfortunately. I'm still workin on it :D
If you are a UI designer or a game dev that has actually shipped, you could probably do better yourself.
